# codesoft--IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The species are:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and data science for introductory classification tasks. It consists of samples of iris flowers, with four features (measurements) for each sample:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

## Objectives

- To build a classification model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.
- To visualize the dataset and the decision boundaries of the classification model.
- To evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset is available in CSV format and can be found in the repository. It can also be easily accessed through the `sklearn.datasets` library.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
